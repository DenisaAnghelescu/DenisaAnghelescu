# VendingMachine
This mini-application was developed at one of the Java classes I was enrolled in. This was developed with the help of my colleagues and we worked together as a team.
During this mini project I put in practice what I acquired at that time and I gained knowledge that I didn`t have before. 
This mini-project opened up my desire to want for more.
